BATTinfo is a simple batch script that shows some info about the battery installed in your laptop, and allows you to generate a report with in-depth battery info.

**IMPORTANT:** There is a high possibility a recent windows update completely bricked BATTinfo and BATTinfo Classic. I haven't done any tests on Windows 11 **yet**, however the script no longer works as expected on Windows 10. Feel free to send feedback while I work on a fix.

.EXE version available since 3/27/2024!
